                    Cryptex 2021 will begin at 6:00 PM on 5th March 2021 and end on 7th March 11:59 PM.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cryptex 2021 consists of 27 levels of generally increasing difficulty. You will receive successive questions upon solving and entering the answer of each level and/or completing the task involved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cryptex 2021 is introducing bonus questions for the first time! We will be releasing two bonus questions twice during the event. The exact timing of these questions will be released right before the event starts. Solving one bonus question gives you a
                    lifeline which you may use as you please before they expire.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The winner will be the first person to complete all the levels. In case no one completes Cryptex before 2359 IST 7th March 2021, the person occupying the first position on the leaderboard will be declared the winner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The competition is open to everyone, anywhere on the globe.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We will provide a platform to communicate with the moderators and ask for hints. Using any platform to disclose questions/solutions will result in instant disqualification.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a question involves typing answers in an answer box, <strong>the answers should be typed completely 
            in lowercase, without any spaces, punctuation, special characters or numerals.</strong> The only exception to this is when the answer is a numeral greater than 1000 or when the answer is a special character. Examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If your answer is American Pie, type americanpie
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your answer is Just 4 Laughs, type justfourlaughs
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your answer is 42069, type 42069
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The questions may also involve interacting with the page itself, following hyperlinks, exploring the portal, etc. Nothing is as it seems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any attempt to access levels you have not yet reached or any form of attack on the servers will result in instant disqualification.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The organizer’s decision is final in any case.
                </li>
            </ol>
            TL;DR: Have fun, make friends, have a blast. Enter answers only in lowercase alphabet without spaces except in certain special cases.

                    Google is your friend. Usually. You’re expected to use Google and other online tools in your quest to crack the questions. Do keep in mind that Google may give you erroneous results in certain cases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The questions are open-ended, may have red herrings, cheeky hints and may lead you on wild goose chases. If you are getting nowhere with a certain approach, do consider that you might be on the wrong train of thought.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the other hand, it could be that the answer is ‘colour’ when you have been trying ‘color’. Check for alternate spelling, names and other such variations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Clues might be hidden (especially in the first few questions) to reduce wrong trains of attack. Their absence, however, does not indicate anything.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hints to the questions will be released on the group based on certain factors. The hints and even the titles of the question may not have any apparent meaning until you figure of the answer and/or receive another part of the clue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Group is the quickest way to reach the moderators of the Treasure Hunt. You may ask for hints on the forum.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The questions might involve literary references, simple cryptography, wordplay, steganography, conventional puzzles or maybe simple connect questions.
