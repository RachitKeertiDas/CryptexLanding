            Cryptex 2020 will be 54 hour-long event, and will start at
            6:30 PM on 24th January 2020 and end on 26 January, 11:59 PM.
          </li>
          <li>
             Cryptex 2020 consists of 28 levels of generally increasing difficulty. You will receive successive questions upon solving and entering the answer of each level and/or completing the task involved.

          </li>
          <li>
             The winner will be the first person to complete all the levels. In case no one completes Cryptex before 2359 IST 26th Jan 2020, the person occupying the first position on the leaderboard will be declared the winner.

          </li>
          <li>
            The competition is open to everyone, anywhere on the globe.

          </li>
          <li>
            We will provide a platform to communicate with the moderators and ask for hints. Using any platform to disclose questions/solutions will result in instant disqualification.

          </li>
          <li>
            If a question involves typing answers in an answer box, the answers should be typed completely in lowercase, without any spaces, punctuation, special characters or numerals. The only exception to this is when the answer is a numeral greater than 1000 or when the answer is a special character. 
          </li>
          <li>
          The questions may also involve interacting with the page itself, following hyperlinks etc. Nothing is as it seems.

          </li>
          <li>
            Any attempt to access levels you have not yet reached or any form of
            attack on the servers will result in immediate disqualification.
          </li>
          <li>
            The organizer’s decision is final in any case.
          </li>
          <li>
            The event can be cancelled in the case of insufficient
            participation.
          </li>

				<h3>Guidelines</h3>
					<p>What we think you should do</p>
			</header>
			<hr />
			<ol>
          <li>
            Google is your friend. Usually. You’re expected to use Google and
            other online tools in your quest to crack the questions. Do keep in
            mind that Google may give you erroneous results in certain cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reverse searching images might help you in certain cases. Extensions such as Huntress/Lightshot helps.

          </li>
          <li>
           The questions are open-ended, may have red herrings, cheeky hints and may lead you on wild goose chases. If you are getting nowhere with a certain approach, do consider that you might be on the wrong train of thought. 
          </li>
          <li>On the other hand, it could be that the answer is ‘colour’ when you have been trying ‘color’. Check for alternate spelling, names and other such variations. 
			</li>
          <li>
            Clues might be hidden (especially in the first few questions) to
            reduce wrong trains of attack. Their absence, however, does not
            indicate anything.
          </li>
          <li>
             Hints to the questions will be released on the forum at the moderator’s discretion. They’ll generally be released in multiples of 15 minutes starting from 1830 hrs 24th January. However, don’t expect this to be strictly enforced. The hints and even the titles of the question may not have any apparent meaning until you figure out the answer and/or receive another part of the clue.
          </li>
          <li>
            The forum is the quickest way to reach the moderators of Cryptex. You may ask for hints on the forum.  
          </li>
          <li>
            The questions might involve simple cryptography, wordplay, steganography, conventional puzzles or maybe simple connect questions. However, each of them is designed to be solved in a reasonable amount of time with access to just the internet and pen+paper.
